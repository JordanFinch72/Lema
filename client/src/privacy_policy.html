      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>LEMA uses <i>localStorage</i> cookies to: (1) keep you logged in; (2) auto-save your active maps and their collections so that you do not lose work by closing the app.</li>
        <li>localStorage use (1) is opt-in and this cookie can be avoided by not ticking the "Remember me" box when you log in. If you have already done so, logging out will delete the cookie.</li>
        <li>localStorage use (1) is an essential cookie for the proper function of this app. There is currently no way to opt out. If you feel that this option would be important, please contact me.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community Showcase</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>If you wish your map to no longer be shared on the Community Showcase, you may load the map and then re-save it with the "Share to showcase" box unticked.</li>
